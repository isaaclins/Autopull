# Autopuller

## Description
Autopuller is a Python program designed to automate the process of pulling updates from multiple GitHub repositories. It searches through your files for directories containing GitHub repositories and saves their paths in a text file. This allows you to conveniently push updates to all the repositories simultaneously.

## Features
- Automated searching: Autopuller scans your files and identifies directories that contain GitHub repositories.
- Easy setup: Simply provide your GitHub access token in the configuration file to enable the program to interact with the GitHub API.
- Convenient output: The program saves the directory paths of the identified repositories in a text file, making it easy to reference and manage them.

## Usage
1. Install Python on your system (if not already installed).
2. Clone or download the Autopuller repository from GitHub.
3. Navigate to the project directory.
4. Start setup.bat


## Setup
